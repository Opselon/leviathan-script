## 🚀 Getting Started

Getting Leviathan up and running is a simple two-step process.

### Step 1: Installation
Run the following command in your terminal. This will download the latest version of Leviathan, place it in `/usr/local/bin`, and make it executable.

```bash
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Opselon/leviathan-script/main/Leviathan.sh -o /usr/local/bin/leviathan && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/leviathan && sudo bash /usr/local/bin/leviathan
```



> **💡 Pro Tip:** For easier access, create an alias in your shell's configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
> ```bash
> alias leviathan='sudo bash /usr/local/bin/leviathan'
> ```
> After adding the alias, reload your shell (`source ~/.bashrc`) and you can simply type `leviathan` to start the script.

## ⚙️ Dependencies

Leviathan is designed for **Debian-based systems** (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali Linux) and uses `apt` for package management.

The script has a built-in interactive dependency checker. When you first run it, it will find any missing tools and provide a user-friendly menu to manage their installation:
- **Install All:** Automatically install all missing dependencies.
- **Choose Packages:** Select specific tools to install from a list.
- **Skip:** Proceed at your own risk (some modules may not function).

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This script performs powerful operations and requires **root privileges**. It makes significant changes to system configuration files.

-   **Always back up your data** before running major operations.
-   Review the source code to understand what each module does before using it.
-   The author is not responsible for any data loss or system damage. **Use at your own risk.**
